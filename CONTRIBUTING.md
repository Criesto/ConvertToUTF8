# How to contribute to *UTF8-enforcer*

### Did you find a bug?

* **Before** issue a bug please try to reproduce it and ensure the bug was not already reported by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/Criesto/UTF8-enforcer/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/Criesto/UTF8-enforcer/issues/new?assignees=&labels=&template=bug_report.md&title=). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.
* If possible, use the relevant bug report templates to create the issue. 

### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**
* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.
* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.
* Before submitting, please read the [Contributing to UTF8-enforcer](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Criesto/UTF8-enforcer/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) guide to know more about coding conventions and benchmarks.

### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**
Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of script will generally not be accepted (feel free to mention it in the comment).

### **Do you intend to add a new feature or change an existing one?**
* See contact section on GitHub repository. This project is silly small and made to fullfill the need to self-improve, but I will be happy to change it to production-ready program someday.

### **Do you have questions about the source code?**
* Ask any question about how to use my script in the [UTF8-enforcer Google Group](https://groups.google.com/g/utf8-enforcer/).

Thanks!
